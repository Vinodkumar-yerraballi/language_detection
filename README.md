The languages in the dataset is given below such as
'Estonian', 'Swedish', 'Thai', 'Tamil', 'Dutch', 'Japanese',
'Turkish', 'Latin', 'Urdu', 'Indonesian', 'Portugese', 'French',
'Chinese', 'Korean', 'Hindi', 'Spanish', 'Pushto', 'Persian',
'Romanian', 'Russian', 'English', 'Arabic'

# About the data 
 The data is taken from the kaggle website and this is a classification problem to detect the language the process involves severals steps such as load the data and clean the data,data preprocessing, divided the data into X,y and after that divided into train_test_split
After we divided the then move to  predict languge we use four algorithms to predict the language such as
1.MultinomialNB
2.BernouliNB
3.RandomForestClassifier
4.DecisionTreeClassifier
above four algorithms the multnomilaNB give the best prediction to the dataset.And check the model perofrm very well or not using the languages.
#Next do Deployment
We deployee the our model use streamlit software wich is free source and simple way we can deployee the model using the csv files and use some background images and html and css files.
